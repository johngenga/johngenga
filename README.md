## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a supply chain professional with a passion for learning and technology. Here's a bit about me:
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently diving into Python, machine learning, and AI. I'm simply fascinated by this new world and its potential to transform supply chain management.
ðŸ’¼ I'm very keen on lean processes and how they affect businesses. Streamlining operations and improving efficiency is my forte.
ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me anything about supply chain. With my experience, I've encountered a wide range of challenges and solutions.
